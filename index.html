            <h1>Nails are Amazing</h1>
            <p>Ever since I was little I loved nail art. My obsession began when my aunt gave me a kaboodle filled with her
                old nail polish. Needless to say, I was hooked. After running out of space on my own fingers and toes, I
                recruited my female family members to aid in my budding artistry. I got to practice laying the polish down
                smoothly while they got a free manicure. A definite win-win! By the time I got into college I had quite the
                nail art collection. It began as mostly polishes of various colors and finishes; some were satiny while others
                were bright and sparkly and eventually progressed to include rhinestones, stickers, and small clay flowers.
                <br> My roommate and me would play around with different designs to decompress between exams and study halls.
                Needless to say, our nails stayed on point all throughout our matriculation.</p>

            <h2>Off to Beauty School</h2>
            <p>After graduation I moved to Tampa to be closer to my grandmother. While trying to figure out if I truly wanted
                togo to law school, I decided to enroll in a local beauty school. I figured my time deciding should be spent
                doing something that was both productive and enjoyable and with a nail tech certification, I could always
                work freelance. So away I went to Manhattan Beauty Academy as a fledgling nail tech.
                <br> Once enrolled, I was given my first acrylic nail kit. It included files, a brush, and the liquid and powers
                to sculpt acrylic nails. Having only used nail polish, it took some time to get accustomed to working with
                acrylic. The way it works is that you use the brush soaked in monimer (nail liquid) to pick up a tiny bit
                of the acrylic powder that you then use to apply by patting onto the nail. It hardens very quickly and as
                a nail tech, you're paid by the number of clients you can service so speed was key. Within a few weeks, I
                was churning out full sets with designs and french tips in less than an hour. The efficiency and quality
                of my work really impressed my instructors and clients and I was ecstatic that I was learning more and more
                about something I was really passionate about.
            </p>
            <h2>Perfecting the Craft</h2>
            <p>Once I got the acrylic thing down I started following nail tutorials on youtube to learn new techniques. My mind
                was blown at all the different effects one could do with paint, acrylic, embellishments, and gels. I had
                to learn them all. Roses are one of my favorite things to make with acrylic, so I practiced sculpting them
                between clients. With time, acrylic sculpting became my specialty. Many of my clients were sweet enough to
                let me use their nails to practice on. I'd give them flowers, swirls, and bows, sometimes little characters
                like Hello Kitty.
                <br>Since my time in beauty school my nail collection has grown from that humble kaboodle to include multicolored
                acrylics and gels, alloy and gem embellishments, way too many nail polishes to count along with stickers,
                foils, holographic flake, stamps and pigment powders. Unfortunately, I don't do nails professionally anymore
                but I made some great friends and memories that I'll remember fondly. It was such a great experience learning
                and doing something that I loved and I get the feeling my time with Launch Code will be just as fulfilling.
