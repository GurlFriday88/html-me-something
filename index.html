            <h2>Nails are Amazing</h2>

            <p>Ever since I was little I loved nail art. My obsession began when my aunt gave me a kaboodle filled with her
                old nail polish. Needless to say, I was hooked. After running out of space on my own fingers and toes, I
                recruited my female family members to aid in my budding artistry. I got to practice laying the polish down
                smoothly while they got a free manicure. A definite win-win! By the time I got into college I had quite the
                nail art collection. It began as mostly polishes of various colors and finishes; some were satiny while others
                were bright and sparkly and eventually progressed to include rhinestones, stickers, and small clay flowers.
                <br> My roommate and I would play around with different designs to decompress between exams and study halls.
                Needless to say, our nails stayed on point all throughout our matriculation lol.</p>

                <figcaption>An initial attempt at incorporating embellishments. These were done on nails chips. Much easier to design
                    on than on the actual nail.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>Off to Beauty School</h2>
            <p>After graduation I moved to Tampa to be closer to my grandmother. While trying to figure out if I truly wanted
                togo to law school, I decided to enroll in a local beauty school. I figured my time deciding should be spent
                doing something that was both productive and enjoyable. Plus, with a nail tech certification, I could always
                work freelance. So away I went to Manhattan Beauty Academy as a fledgling nail tech.
                <br>Once enrolled, I was given my first acrylic nail kit. It included files, a brush, and the liquid and powders
                to sculpt acrylic nails. Having only used nail polish, it took some time to get accustomed to working with
                acrylic.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/nailkit.jpg" alt="Picture of nail tech supplies">
                <figcaption> The way nail acrylic works is that you use the brush soaked in monimer (nail liquid) to pick up a tiny bit
                    of the acrylic powder that you then use to apply by patting onto the nail. It hardens very quickly and
                    as a nail tech, you're paid by the number of clients you can service so speed is key. </figcaption>

                <img src="./images/stonefrench.jpg" alt="French manicured nails with blue stones">
                <figcaption>Within a few weeks, I was churning out full sets with designs and french tips in less than an hour. The efficiency
                    and quality of my work really impressed my instructors and clients. I was ecstatic that I was learning
                    more and more about something I was really passionate about.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Sculpted on the nail in black acrylic inlaid with gold flake. These are some fierce claws!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>Perfecting the Craft</h2>
            <p>Once I got the acrylic thing down I started following nail tutorials on youtube to learn new techniques. My mind
                was blown at all the different effects one could do with paint, acrylic, embellishments, and gels. I had
                to learn them all. Roses are one of my favorite things to make with acrylic, so I practiced sculpting them
                between clients. With time, acrylic sculpting became my specialty. Many of my clients were sweet enough to
                let me use their nails to practice on. I'd give them flowers, swirls, and bows, sometimes little characters.</p>

                <figcaption>I was really into Japanese nail art at one time. These kind of remind me of easter eggs.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/purplerose.jpg" alt="Purple and pink nails with white roses">
                <figcaption>My absolute favorite set ever!! These were so fun to make.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Competition length nails are perfect for practicing designs. No one but the brave actually wear nails at
                    this length lol.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/roseleaf.jpg" alt="Clear Pointed nail decorated with silver glitter and roses">
                <figcaption>Nail can come in a variety of shapes and lengths. This one is called a dart tip. The rose inside it was made
                    first and the nail was sculpted around it; fun stuff.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/pinkflower.jpg" alt="Nail chip on stick painted with pink flower">
                <figcaption>More flowers....ok so nails aren't my only obsession.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/minions.jpg" alt="Blue glitter nails with minion cartoon character on index fingers">
                <figcaption>Another request from Danielle. She really liked that movie and was really excited for these.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/cosmic.jpg" alt="Long blue and purple nail with inlaid mylar flakes">
                <figcaption>Mylar flakes are simply the best thing ever. When the light hits the flakes just right it's gorgeous.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/donut.jpg" alt="Hand holding sprinkled donut showcasing matching nail design">
                <figcaption>We got donuts that day so I wanted my nails to match my stomach lol.</figcaption>
                <img src="./images/stormtrooper.jpg" alt="Small acrylic Starwars storm trooper on gold plastic ">
                <figcaption>Yet another request from Danielle. At this point she was just wanting to see if I could make a stormtrooper
                    that could fit on a fingernail. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Since beauty school, my nail collection has grown from that humble kaboodle to include multicolored acrylics
                and gels, alloy and gem embellishments, way too many nail polishes to count along with stickers, foils, holographic
                flake, stamps and pigment powders. Unfortunately, I don't do nails professionally anymore but I"ll occasionally
                bust out the kit when the mood strikes. Again I say, nails are awesome. They helped me make some great friends
                and memories that I'll remember fondly. It was such a great experience learning and doing something that
                I loved and I get the feeling my time with Launch Code will be just as fulfilling.
                <br> Thanks for reading!</p>
